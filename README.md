## 🧠 The Problem

As a developer, I often had to test and debug emails — OTPs, onboarding messages, offer mailers — that were generated by backend systems and stored as **HTML blobs in a PostgreSQL database**.

Here’s what I had to do every time:

- 🔍 Run raw SQL queries to fetch the HTML body
- 🧱 Manually find the correct column
- 🧼 Clean up the HTML if needed
- 🧪 Paste into a third-party viewer
- 🧠 Mentally track which email came from which flow

👉 This was slow, inconsistent, and a major **productivity blocker**.

---

## ⚠️ The Pain Points

| Challenge | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🔌 High friction | SQL, copy-paste, external viewers — repeated every time |
| 🧭 No standardization | Couldn’t share previews or workflows with teammates |
| 🧱 HTML not human-friendly | No live rendering or clickable buttons |
| 🛑 Local-only access | Couldn’t demo or share test results |
| 🔄 Switching DBs manually | Staging vs Prod vs UAT was error-prone |
| 🔍 OTP/Email-based testing was slow | Had to hunt through logs to debug |

---

## 🧠 My Solution (3 Phases)

### ✅ Phase 1: 🐚 Bash Script + Chrome Automation

I started with a **quick hack**:

```bash
psql -U user -d dbname -c "SELECT html_body FROM email_logs WHERE email='xyz@example.com'" > output.txt
google-chrome --incognito output.txt
````

* Mapped to a keyboard shortcut 🖱️
* Worked fine, but Chrome was heavy and HTML was raw/unrendered
* Still had to fetch fresh mails manually

### 😤 The breaking point

One day, I had to test **6 different transactional emails**, each sent on different triggers. I found myself in this loop:

- Trigger action  
- Run the script  
- Chrome opens again  
- Close old tab  
- Repeat ×6

It was distracting, sluggish, and honestly annoying.  
That’s when I thought: _“Why not just make a live browser view that pulls the email automatically?”_

---


### ✅ Phase 2: 🛠 Laravel-Powered Email Viewer

I built a full-fledged **internal web app** with Laravel:

* Connected to our **PostgreSQL** DB
* Fetched latest N emails or by `email_id`
* Rendered the HTML inside the browser — just like Gmail would!
* Auto-refreshed every **30 seconds** to catch new mails
* Added filters to show OTP/Onboarding/Offer emails

📈 This made my testing 10x faster and way more visual.

### 🧱 The next roadblock

While the Laravel app was a huge upgrade, it wasn’t perfect for *collaborative testing*.

Here’s what started becoming a hassle:

- 🔒 The app was hosted locally on my machine — no one else could access it
- 🔄 Every new team member had to set up the environment just to test emails
- 🛠️ Backend changes meant I had to redeploy or explain local setup
- 🔗 Sharing a specific email meant taking a screenshot or copying raw HTML

It was functional, but not scalable.  
I realized — _"If testers and devs could view emails without touching code, it would save everyone time."_

---



### ✅ Phase 3: 🌐 Hosting + Ngrok + Sharing

To remove the "local-only" bottleneck:

* Hosted it locally at `http://higgsboson.in` (using host file mapping)
* Hooked into **Ubuntu startup script** to boot Laravel + Ngrok
* Used **Ngrok** to expose the tool with a public URL
* Ran a `curl` command to post the link to a **Google Chat webhook** for team access

```bash
ngrok http 8000 > /dev/null &
sleep 3
PUBLIC_URL=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4040/api/tunnels | jq -r '.tunnels[0].public_url')
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"text\": \"🔗 Higgs Boson is live: $PUBLIC_URL\"}" \
  https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/spaces/XYZ/messages?key=ABC
```
### 🚀 What I unlocked with this setup

This phase changed everything.

✅ No more "Hey, can you send me the email again?"  
✅ No more "Wait, it only works on your machine?"

Here’s what this automation achieved:

- 🔗 **One-click access**: Every time I booted up, a fresh Ngrok link was auto-generated and posted in our team’s Google Chat
- 🧠 **Zero manual steps**: I didn’t have to explain how to access or use anything — just “click the link”
- 👨‍💻 **Cross-team visibility**: QA, Product, Dev — everyone had real-time access to transactional emails
- 🛡️ **No production data risk**: It worked on our internal test DB, so we kept security intact

This small hack saved hours in communication and boosted our testing + feedback loop speed drastically.

## 📌 Why This Matters

> This wasn’t just a tool — it solved a **real problem** in my daily development workflow.

I went from copy-pasting raw HTML into Chrome tabs…
To running a fully automated, live-sharing, real-time preview platform —
That saved me (and my QA) hours every week, especially during deadline QA crunch.
